Simply Fit offers personalized training tracks to help their customers achieve their desired level of 
fitness and health. Currently, Personal Trainers work directly with their clients, but Simply Fit is looking 
to expand their services to include a subscription-based web app that will allow users to create custom workouts
 from a selection of exercises aimed at different fitness goals. Customers can create different levels of 
 accounts to access premium features like scheduling a 1-on-1 with a personal trainer or recording their 
 workout metrics.
